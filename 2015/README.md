## Background

[Back to the contents](#contents)

I was feeling a little bit discouraged after some silly little mistakes, I decided to take it easy on myself and I do some old challenges to try my luck

Decided when tackling for the first time: [adventofcode.com/2022/day/9](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/9)

## Installation

[Back to the contents](#contents)

The ideal would be that no package was required to be installed at all, even tho that's not usually the case.

For the installation of any packages required in this project, run the following command:

```bash
# windows version
python3 -m pip3 install -r requirements.txt
# linux version
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## CLI

[Back to the contents](#contents)

As I've done with [2022](https://github.com/jofaval/advent-of-code/tree/master/2022) and [2021](https://github.com/jofaval/advent-of-code/tree/master/2022) I wanted to create a CLI.

But python's packaging doesn't allow for the flexibility I was provided with in previous languages (Typescript and Golang)

### Structure

[Back to the contents](#contents)

_To be fully defined_

### Create a day

[Back to the contents](#contents)

This would be my proposal, it's still not finalized

```bash
python3 --action create --day 1
# or the shortcut version
python3 -a create -d 1
```

### Run a day

[Back to the contents](#contents)

This would be my proposal, it's still not finalized

```bash
python3 --action run --day 1
# or the shortcut version
python3 -a run -d 1
```
