# 2022

Done with Typescript at first

## Installation/Setup

```bash
pnpm install # or npm or yarn
```

If you decide to run this project, you'll be needing to build typescript.
I'm running the following command on a parallel terminal:

```bash
pnpm run watch:ts
```

## Structure

All files should follow the following structure:

- day-[Number of the day]
  - main.ts (optional, but recomended)
  - first, _to complete the first start_
    - example-input.txt, _provided by the challenge_
    - input.txt, _required to submit the challenge_
  - second, _after completing the first start_
    - example-input.txt, _provided by the challenge_
    - input.txt, _required to submit the challenge_

## Challenges

1. [Day 1](./day-1/)
