# Roadmap

This roadmap won't go by versioning, nor by year, not even in a linear/chronological order, it's what I'd like to do with this "project", every challenge (both stars/parts).

[Ones I would like to try for future years](#ones-i-would-like-to-try-for-future-years)

## 2022

Typescript (one of the languages I've used the most profesionally)

## 2021

Golang (had somewhat of a base, but not that much)

## 2015

Python (personal, academic and somewhat profesional experience)

## 2016

PHP (one of the languages I've used the most profesionally)

## 2017

Ruby (no idea whatsoever, I did a quick syntax run)

## 2018

C# (academic and profesional experience)

## 2019

Java (oh God no, please save me!!), maybe Kotlin?

## 2020

C++ (I did a codecademy complete course on it... aaaand that's it!!)

## 2023

## Ones I would like to try for future years

Or that I'll be on the look for

- Rust (duh!)
- Carbon?
- Zig?
- I've seen some SQL challenges run-throughs
- Swift, I don't even a MacOS
- Scala
- Kotlin
- R, might actually be a great idea for algorithms
